# trello-shopping-list-manager

---

This is just a small php script that removes duplicates from a Trello board. I use this to clean up my "shopping list" board since I always accidentally add duplicate items.

## How to use

Update the `config.php` and the call `cronjob.php` as often as you want. You also cann use Web Hooks from https://ifttt.com/ as a trigger.
